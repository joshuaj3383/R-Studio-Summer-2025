Collection of projects I did in my R&R Studio class.
The first one is an analysis of covid data taken from "COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University".
The second is an analysis of tourism data by country and year. 

These will be privated shortly to avoid possible plagarism :)
